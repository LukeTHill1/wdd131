                This page will be dedicated to the Emblems you can obtain both in the main storyline and the DLC, showing the increases to certain stats that a character can receive just by equipping it, and the different Engage skills and how many skill points (which are received by defeating enemies) each one will cost, along with an explanation of what they do.
                <br>In Fire Emblem Engage, Emblem Rings and Bond Rings are special mechanics that allow players to power up their characters by linking them to the spirits of heroes from past Fire Emblem games. Here’s how both of these mechanics work and what they bring to gameplay:</br>
            </p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    Emblem Rings are the primary mechanic that allows players to summon the spirits of classic heroes known as Emblems. 
                    <br>Each Emblem Ring is linked to a well-known Fire Emblem hero, like Marth or Celica, who grants powerful abilities and special skills.</br>
                    <br>Here’s how they work in detail:</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Summoning Emblems</h2>
                <p> 
                    Characters equipped with Emblem Rings can summon and "Engage" with an Emblem hero. 
                    <br>When a character Engages, they merge with the hero's spirit for a few turns, enhancing their stats and unlocking unique abilities.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Engage Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Each Emblem grants character-specific skills and abilities that can turn the tide of battle. 
                    <br>For example, Marth’s ring might grant abilities focused on evasion and critical hits, while Celica’s might provide magic-oriented skills.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Engage Attacks</h2>
                <p>
                    While Engaged, characters can perform powerful attacks that combine their own abilities with the Emblem’s unique powers.
                    <br>These special moves often have high damage output and added effects depending on the type of battle style the character has.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Synchronization Bonuses</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters wearing Emblem Rings gain passive benefits even when they aren’t Engaged.
                    <br>These include stat boosts and minor effects that reflect the Emblem's strengths.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Bond Levels</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters can develop bonds with Emblems over time, leveling up these bonds to unlock new skills and stat boosts.
                </p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    Bond Rings are a secondary option for enhancing characters, providing smaller stat boosts and customization options compared to Emblem Rings. 
                    <br>Here’s how they function:</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Crafting Bond Rings</h2>
                <p>
                    Bond Rings are created at the Somniel (your hub area) by spending Bond Fragments. 
                    <br>Each Bond Ring corresponds to characters from previous Fire Emblem games, though they’re not as powerful or interactive as Emblem Rings.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Stat Boosts</h2>
                <p>
                    Bond Rings provide simple stat bonuses, like +1 to strength, defense, or magic, rather than unique skills or abilities.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Collectibility and Rarity</h2>
                <p>
                    Bond Rings come in different rarity levels, from C to S, with higher-ranked rings providing greater stat boosts. 
                    <br>Players can collect multiple rings for variety and combine duplicates to increase their rank.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Supplementary Use</h2>
                <p>
                    Since you only have a limited number of Emblem Rings, Bond Rings are a helpful way to boost characters who don't have access to an Emblem Ring.
                </p>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <h2>DLC</h2>
            <p>
                In Fire Emblem Engage, Emblem Bracelets are similar to Emblem Rings, adding another dimension to the gameplay by introducing new Emblems (heroes from past Fire Emblem games) through special bracelets rather than rings. These Emblem Bracelets were added through DLC content and bring unique abilities and tactical possibilities to the game.
                <br>Here’s how Emblem Bracelets work and what they add to the Fire Emblem Engage experience:</br>
            </p>

            <button class="accordion">Emblem Bracelets Overview</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>New Emblems</h2>
                <p>
                    Emblem Bracelets introduce additional Emblems that are separate from the main game’s Emblem Rings.
                    <br>For example, characters like Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude from Fire Emblem: Three Houses appear together, or the new guard skills that protect the equipped unit from harm from certian weapons.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Equip and Engage</h2>
                <p>
                    Just like with Emblem Rings, players can equip characters with Emblem Bracelets, allowing them to “Engage” with these heroes in battle to temporarily gain powerful abilities, stat boosts, and unique skills.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Emblem Trios</h2>
                <p>
                    Some Emblem Bracelets, such as the one containing Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude, allow players to Engage with multiple heroes at once.
                    <br>These "Emblem Trios" offer a variety of abilities, sometimes providing access to skills that would otherwise be split across multiple Emblems.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Unique Skills and Abilities</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Special Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Each Emblem Bracelet brings its own set of skills that enhance the character equipped with the bracelet.
                    <br>For instance, the Edelgard/Dimitri/Claude bracelet grants powerful weapon skills and versatility in combat, allowing players to switch between the three heroes’ abilities.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Engage Attack</h2>
                <p>
                    Each Emblem Bracelet also provides a unique Engage Attack.
                    <br>The Trio bracelet, for example, has an Engage Attack that deals damage using each hero’s unique weapon type, creating a multi-attack that can break through enemy defenses effectively and gains a boost when activated when next to the unit holding Byleths ring.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Bond Level Progression</h2>
                <p>
                    Like Emblem Rings, Emblem Bracelets have bond levels that increase as you fight with them equipped, unlocking additional skills and stat boosts over time.
                </p>
