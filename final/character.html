                This page will be dedicated to the different characters that are given in the mainline and DLC content. 
                <br>This page will start with a few explanations about character skills, classes, their stats, and how they grow.</br>
                <br>Then there will be a report of each character consisting of a general explanation of they are, their pros and cons, and how they can be made to stay useful throughout the entire game until the final chapter.</br>
	
	            In Fire Emblem Engage, characters are central to both the story and gameplay, each offering unique abilities, personalities, and growth opportunities. 
                <br>Here’s a breakdown of how characters work, including their roles, progression, and roles: </br>
            </p>

            <button class="accordion">Character Classes</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Starting Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character begins in a specific class that determines their initial abilities, stats, weapon proficiencies, and general role on the battlefield. 
                    <br>Classes include traditional roles like Sword Fighter, Archer, Mage, Cavalier, and Martial Monk.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Class Promotions</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters can upgrade or change classes through a system of promotions. 
                    <br>Using Master Seals or Second Seals, players can advance characters to stronger versions of their base class starting when they hit level 10 (like Sword Fighter to Swordmaster) or switch them to other classes to fit their playstyle or strategy.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Advanced Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Once promoted, characters can access new abilities, weapons, and improved stats. 
                    <br>Some advanced classes have unique skills that enhance a character’s effectiveness and versatility.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Stats and Growth Rates</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Core Stats</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters have core stats that affect their performance in combat. These include:
                    <br>HP (Health Points): Determines how much damage a character can take.</br>
                    <br>Strength: Affects physical attack power.</br>
                    <br>Magic: Influences the power of magic attacks.</br>
                    <br>Dexterity: Affects hit rate and critical hit chance.</br>
                    <br>Speed: Determines Attack Speed (AS) and ability to double-attack or avoid being double-attacked.</br>
                    <br>Defense: Reduces damage taken from physical attacks.</br>
                    <br>Resistance: Reduces damage taken from magical attacks.</br>
                    <br>Build: Affects how well a character can wield heavy weapons without a speed penalty.</br>
                    <br>Luck: Provides minor boosts to hit rate, dodge rate, and critical avoid rate.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Growth Rates</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character has unique growth rates for these stats. 
                    <br>These determine how likely each stat is to increase when the character levels up.</br>
                    <br>Some characters may excel in physical stats, while others have higher growth in magic or speed.</br>
                </p>

            <button class="accordion">Emblem Rings and Bond Rings</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Emblem Rings</h2>
                <p>
                    Emblem Rings let characters “Engage” with legendary heroes from past Fire Emblem games. 
                    <br>When equipped with an Emblem Ring, a character can merge with the hero’s spirit, gaining access to Engage Skills, special abilities, and stat boosts.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Bonds Levels</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character can build a Bond Level with Emblems by fighting while equipped with their ring. 
                    <br>As Bond Levels increase, the character unlocks additional skills and stat boosts, enhancing their capabilities in combat.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Bonds Rings</h2>
                <p>
                    These are simpler rings that provide minor stat bonuses but don’t allow characters to Engage. 
                    <br>Bond Rings can be created using Bond Fragments and offer collectible, stackable benefits for characters who don’t have an Emblem Ring.</br>
                </p>

            <button class="accordion">Skills and Abilities</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Class Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Each class comes with unique skills that characters automatically gain by being in that class. 
                    <br>These skills provide bonuses or abilities suited to the class role.</br>
                    <br>For example, a healer class might have a skill that boosts healing effectiveness.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Inheritable Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    As characters build Bond Levels with Emblems, they can inherit certain skills permanently. 
                    <br>This allows for further customization, as players can tailor skills to make characters more versatile and better suited to specific combat situations.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Personal Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character also has a unique personal skill that reflects their personality or role in the story. 
                    <br>These skills are active regardless of class and provide bonuses or situational advantages.</br>
                    <br>For example, a character might have a personal skill that grants a bonus when near allies or that boosts their damage under certain conditions.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Character customization and Progression</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Leveling Up and Stat Gains</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters gain experience and level up through combat, with random stat gains based on growth rates. 
                    <br>Leveling up is essential for improving a character’s stats and preparing them for class promotion.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Class Change with Seals</h2>
                <p>
                    By using Master Seals (for promotions) and Second Seals (for changing classes), players can explore different character roles, allowing flexibility and experimentation with builds. 
                    <br>This can help optimize a character’s strengths or balance out weaknesses.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Somniel Activities</h2>
                <p>
                    At the Somniel, characters can engage in activities like working out, eating meals, or sparring, which provide temporary buffs and improve Support Levels. 
                    <br>These activities allow players to boost stats or gain minor advantages before entering a battle.</br>
                </p>

            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Styles</h2>
                <p>
                    Battle Styles are a type of attribute assigned to all units. Each grants a unique bonus or ability. In general, the Battle Style a unit has matches up with the type of unit they are, such as:
                    <br>Dragon: Gain additional effects when Engaged with Emblems.</br>
                    <br>Backup: Will engage in Chain Attacks if they are in the range of an enemy being attacked by a player unit.</br>
                    <br>Covert: Receive doubled terrain bonus effects.</br>
                    <br>Mystical: Attack magic ignores enemy terrain bonuses.</br>
                    <br>Qi Adept: Can protect adjacent allies with Chain Guard if their HP is full.</br>
                    <br>Cavalry: Have a higher movement than other units.</br>
                    <br>Armored: Immunity to Break.</br>
                    <br>Flying: Unencumbered by terrain.</br>

            <h1>Main-Line</h1>
            <h2>Lythos</h2>

            <button class="accordion">Alear</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <img class="character" src="images/lythos/Alear_Profile.jpg" alt="Both Alears">
                <h2>Who is Alear?</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Alear is an Avatar(character with player-defined traits), as well as the main character of Engage.
                    <br>They are forced to be used on every main story map, and their death causes a game over.</br>
                    <br>In Chapter 11, Alear must be brought to the escape point.</br>

                    1,000 years before the events of Engage, Alear, a divine dragon, fell into a deep slumber after the defeat of the Fell Dragon.
                    <br>They wake up after 1,000 years to find the seal on the Fell Dragon weakening, with its reawakening imminent.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Alear's memory is hazy due to having amnesia but they retains a spirit of positivity and courteousness. 
                    <br>Polite as one can expect of a Divine Dragon, Alear warmly greets and interacts with the members of their army and the people of Elyos. </br>
                    <br>Though they lost their memories of Lumera, Alear quickly bonds with her and adopts many of their mother's mannerisms. </br>
                    <br>Their journey tests their convictions, and even when near death, Alear refuses to give up and finds rather unorthodox solutions using the powers of their allies.</br>

                    Despite their status as a Divine Dragon, Alear does not force people to address them with formalities and their title, preferring that they simply refer to them by name if they want to. 
                    <br>At times they are uncomfortable being the object of worship, especially when done in their presence. </br>
                    <br>Nonetheless, they are touched by the people's faith in them and fiercely protective of Elyos itself and its denizens.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Personal skill: Divinely Inspiring</h3>
                <p>Adjacent Allies deal +3 damage and take 1 less damage.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    Alear is a strong character even in the first few chapters, it is very hard to take their hit points down to zero. 
                    <br>Their Dragon child class is the “Lord” class that every protagonist in the Fire Emblem games has and in regular fashion with their regular deployment makes them the highest level character.</br>
                </p>
                <p>-Alear has a good enough mix of dexterity and speed that allows them to do follow-up attacks each time they initiate combat which gives their average strength a chance to capitalize on the multiple attacks they can do in a turn.</p>
                <p>-With their battle style of Dragon, they can pretty much wield any Emblem with every little drawback except taking it from another unit that might need it more and giving the engage skills/attacks a consistent addition effect or effects depending on the Emblem.</p>
                <p>-When they advance to their advanced class Divine Dragon which gives the ability to wield the Marshel Arts covering their low resistance stat and giving them an advantage against bows, tomes, and staves.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    Just because they are the main character, does not mean they are the perfect unit and they do have some flaws that can be exploited by the enemies.
                </p>
                <p>-Their resistance is low enough that you would have to be worried about them being surrounded by magic users, especially with their low weapon range until Chapter 25 when they get the Wille Glanz but that’s two chapters away from the end of the game.</p>
                <p>-Even though they don’t use their magic stat with their classes, with how low it gets it does keep him from using emblems that focus on the magic stat.</p>
                <p>-His attack stat is average which leaves his attacks bouncing off of armored units in the earlier chapters without an Armorslayer.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>How to make them useful</h2>
                <p>
                    As they stand, the most that you as the player can do for their stats is to give them a few tailsmen and maybe an energy drop for some extra strength, along with keeping a set of resistance tonics on hand if needed. 
                    <br>On the other hand, for their emblems, there are a lot of options to pick from so I will sum it down to the two that will help him survive the longest:</br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marth: This is the basic answer with his increases to Avoid and the Sword Agility skills gained from bond levels, along with Unyielding that restores hp when they go below a certain percentage and Break Defenses that give an extra attack after inflicting Break. 
                    <br>This is a strong choice especially when paired with skills like Ike’s Resolve which boosts defense and resistance if their HP stays under 75 percent, Roy’s Hold out which allows the unit to survive with 1 HP if they have a certain HP at the start of combat, and or Lyn’s Alacrity which allows them to do their follow up attack before the foe can counter attack.</br>
                    <br>And if you have access to the Emblem Bracelets then look at skills like weapon sync from the triplets or Brute force from Chrom & Robin.</br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Corrin: This is my personal choice with her increases in HP and the Quality time skill that restores HP to adjacent allies creating an interesting synergy with their Personal skill Divinvely Inspiring, along with being able to access all the dragon veins that she has available that give special effects to the terrain and Draconic Hex that lowers all the foes stats by 4 shrinking by 1 each turn. 
                    <br>This gives them a large HP pool to take hits from even magic users and can be made stronger when paired with skills like Marth’s Perception which gives a boost to Avoid when the unit starts combat and increases with higher speed stats, Ike’s Resolve which boosts defense and resistance if their HP stays under 75 percent, Roy’s Hold out which allows the unit to survive with 1 HP if they have a certain HP at the start of combat, and or Lyn’s Alacrity which allows them to do their follow up attack before the foe can counter attack.</br>
                    <br>And if you have access to the Emblem Bracelets then look at skills like weapon sync from the triplets, Brute force from Chrom & Robin, or Geosphere/Lifesphere/Lightsphere from Tiki if you want to boost the synergy with Quality Time and their Personal skill.</br>
                </p>

                <h2>Who is Vander?</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Vander is a 32nd-generation, Steward of the Dragon, protector of the Divine Dragon at the Land of Lythos. Honored by his duty, Vander is Alear's primary caretaker, however due to his advancing age, he personally selected Clanne and Framme as his successors.
                    <br>Throughout the Divine Dragon's journey across Elyos, Vander provides them with protection and counsel.</br>
                    <br>Following Sombron's defeat, Vander cedes his role as Steward to Clanne and Framme and becomes a knight of the Somniel.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Vander takes great pride in his role as the Steward of the Dragon and as such approaches his care with Queen Lumera and Alear with the highest of decorum. 
                    <br>His highest priority is the protection of Alear and often does mundane chores for them so they can focus more on their leadership duties.</br>
                    <br>After Alear expresses a desire to be a little more independent and not requiring Vander to do all of their less important tasks, he respects their request, but nonetheless proves to be a stalwart ally and still earnestly acts as an advisor throughout their journey.</br>

                    A veteran in his duties, Vander trains Clanne and Framme with sternness over their childish enthusiasm in the presence of the Divine Dragon. 
                    <br>Despite his occasional gruffness and harshness, he expresses utmost faith in his two successors and genuinely wishes to train them to uphold the standards he too was taught.</br>
                    <br>Vander experiences allows him to offer sagely advice to other members of Alear's forces, providing wise counsel to the likes of Alfred and Amber.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Personal skill: Alabaster Duty</h3>
                <p>If this unit is adjacent to the Divine Dragon, grants Crit+5 during combat to both Vander and the Divine Dragon.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    Vander is a good character to have at the start of the game being given in his advanced class and being able to boost Alear just by being near him on the map. 
                    <br>He can deal some damage to enemies, softening them up for the weaker units at the beginning of the story to gain some easier experience points, and is the first axe user in the game.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    Vander is considered a Jagen Archytype, being a strong starting advanced class with slightly higher starting stats making him a valuable damage soaker for some of the initial maps. 
                    <br>With that said, he suffers from the archetype's greatest flaw of having some of the lowest growths in the game, with his starting growths for Speed and Defense having Growth Rates of 35 and are his highest aside from a Growth Rate of 60 for HP.</br>
                    <br>As such, Vander quickly falls off, and with only 19 levels to work with before he hits the natural cap and requiring a Second Seal to continue forward, he also becomes something of a EXP sponge, giving him far less returns on kills for the maps where he is one of the stronger units base wise and has greater difficulty keeping up with other units who, when invested into, give more consistent returns in the later game.</br>

                <h2>How to make Vander</h2>
                <p>
                    The best thing to do for him is keep him for 10 levels in Paladin then use a second seal to move to Great Knight to capitalize on his other stats while giving him an extra weapon to fight with, and if you have access to Tiki’s Emblem Bracelet from the DLC let him get at least 5 levels with it equipped so he can gain the benefits of Starsphere which grants the unit enhanced stat growth when leveling up. 

                    As for skills, he needs skills that will make sure that he can survive like Ike’s Resolve which boosts defense and resistance if their HP stays under 75 percent, Roy’s Hold out which allows the unit to survive with 1 HP if they have a certain HP at the start of combat, and or Eirika’s Lunar Brace that deals more damage equal to a certain percentage of the foe's defense. 
                    <br>And if you have access to the DLC skills from Hector like Heavy Attack (when making a physical attack, if an equipped weapon's weight exceeds the unit's Build, adds excess as damage to a max of 5) or Adaptability (When hit by a foe's attack, grants Def+2 for a physical attack or Res+2 for a magical attack after combat. Lasts until the end of the battle, or until activated again.)</br>
                    
                    The best Emblem for Vander is the one that will help his miserable ability to hit, especially with his heavy weapons so emblems like Sigurd who gives increases to hit as bond level increases. 
                    <br>If you have the DLC Chrom & Robin to give an increase in Dexterity and Speed, or Hector to give strength when he uses his heavier weapons.</br>

                <h2>Who is Anna</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Anna is a recurring character in the Fire Emblem series. 
                    <br>She has made an appearance in every single Fire Emblem game to date save Fire Emblem Gaiden and its remake, Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia.</br>
                    
                    Anna primarily serves as a whimsical shopkeeper or some form of an NPC in her earliest appearances in the franchise. 
                    <br>Starting from Fire Emblem Awakening forward, Anna has been a playable character, most notably as an important story character in Fire Emblem Heroes.</br>
                    
                    The Anna encountered in each appearance is not the same person, but rather an entire family of women who bear the same appearance and name.
                    
                    Another version of Anna appears in Engage as a playable character. 
                    <br>Unlike her previous iterations, Elyos Anna is notably much younger, being an adolescent girl rather than a young woman.</br>
                    <br>While looking for treasure, she found herself in the middle of a bandit base.</br>
                    <br>When she is nearly caught, she decides to hide in a chest only to be discovered shortly after by the bandits.</br>
                    <br>As luck would have it, Anna would be found by the Divine Dragon Alear and their forces.</br>
                    <br>After teaming up with them and dispatching the bandits, Alear offers her to join their army.</br>
                    
                    Part of Anna's motivation to join Alear is to locate her family. 
                    <br>Originally from a village in Elusia, she was separated from her relatives and has been forced to live on her own as she searches for them.</br>
                    <br>In the aftermath of the war, it seems that she is able to reunite with her family who bears an uncanny resemblance to herself.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite being separate individuals, each Anna that appears shares many traits among each other. 
                    <br>Most notably are their jovial nature and whimsical approach to conducting their business. 
                    <br>Later appearances tend to focus more on her business acumen and a strong desire to acquire wealth, but maintain a lighthearted approach to her business models.

	                The Anna of Engage is notably much younger than her previous incarnations and thus has a childish enthusiasm in her work. 
                    <br>Due to being more of a fledgling merchant in this iteration, she is eager to test her skills and in most of her interactions with her allies, she is trying to broaden her horizons in terms of the goods she can sell from across Elyos.</br>
                    <br>Anna dislikes when she is treated as a child, thus she projects a more mature demeanor and demands that others refer to her as Lady Anna for an unknown reason.</br>
                    <br>Anna misses her family and worries she may never see them again, sometimes crying over this fear.</br>
                </p>

                <p>May obtain 500G when this unit defeats a foe. Trigger %=Lck</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    Just like her relatives in the other games, Anna has great speed, dexterity, and most importantly Luck base stats. 
                    <br>Anna has a speed stat that rivals that of Alear and her magic grows extremely high which makes her a powerful Sage or High priest depending on what you see fit.</br>
                    <br>With her high luck stat, she can activate her Personal Skill at least once every battle which makes for a great way to make additional money to fund the refining of weapons and buying new staves.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, when she joins Alear she is an Axe fighter which does not suit her low strength growth and her high magic growth. 
                    <br>And since she is a child, her HP and defensive stats are extremely low making her very susceptible to physical attackers.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>How to make Anna useful</h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to keep Anna alive and get the most out of her stats is to reclass her into a Material Monk and then advance her into High Priest to get the highest cap on her luck, along with using her magic with Tomes and staves. 
                    <br>Giving her some Seraph Robes to get her HP to livable levels and a Draco shield to give her defense a needed buff will keep her going for more than 2-3 turns.</br>

	                Anna has speed stats that make her faster than Alear and makes great use of Lyn’s Alacrity which allows them to do their follow-up attack before the foe can counterattack, Marth’s Perception which gives a boost to Avoid when the unit starts combat and increases with higher speed stats, and or if you want something more offensive Celica’s Resonance which when equipped with a tome if unit's HP is 2 or more, the unit loses 1 HP at the start of combat and deals +3 damage during combat. 
                    <br>If you have access to the DLC, Soren’s Anima Focus which when using tomes, the unit inflicts Def-3 with fire, Hit-20 with thunder, or Mov-2 with wind magic for 1 turn.</br>

	                One of the best rings to give Anna is Celica to boost her overall magic damage with tomes. 
                    <br>Another good Emblem would be Micaiah which gives her stronger healing with Staves and gives nice utility.</br>
