                This page will be dedicated to the different characters that are given in the mainline and DLC content. 
                <br>This page will start with a few explanations about character skills, classes, their stats, and how they grow.</br>
                <br>Then there will be a report of each character consisting of a general explanation of they are, their pros and cons, and how they can be made to stay useful throughout the entire game until the final chapter.</br>
	
	            In Fire Emblem Engage, characters are central to both the story and gameplay, each offering unique abilities, personalities, and growth opportunities. 
                <br>Here’s a breakdown of how characters work, including their roles, progression, and roles: </br>
            </p>

            <button class="accordion">Character Classes</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Starting Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character begins in a specific class that determines their initial abilities, stats, weapon proficiencies, and general role on the battlefield. 
                    <br>Classes include traditional roles like Sword Fighter, Archer, Mage, Cavalier, and Martial Monk.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Class Promotions</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters can upgrade or change classes through a system of promotions. 
                    <br>Using Master Seals or Second Seals, players can advance characters to stronger versions of their base class starting when they hit level 10 (like Sword Fighter to Swordmaster) or switch them to other classes to fit their playstyle or strategy.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Advanced Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Once promoted, characters can access new abilities, weapons, and improved stats. 
                    <br>Some advanced classes have unique skills that enhance a character’s effectiveness and versatility.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Stats and Growth Rates</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Core Stats</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters have core stats that affect their performance in combat. These include:
                    <br>HP (Health Points): Determines how much damage a character can take.</br>
                    <br>Strength: Affects physical attack power.</br>
                    <br>Magic: Influences the power of magic attacks.</br>
                    <br>Dexterity: Affects hit rate and critical hit chance.</br>
                    <br>Speed: Determines Attack Speed (AS) and ability to double-attack or avoid being double-attacked.</br>
                    <br>Defense: Reduces damage taken from physical attacks.</br>
                    <br>Resistance: Reduces damage taken from magical attacks.</br>
                    <br>Build: Affects how well a character can wield heavy weapons without a speed penalty.</br>
                    <br>Luck: Provides minor boosts to hit rate, dodge rate, and critical avoid rate.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Growth Rates</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character has unique growth rates for these stats. 
                    <br>These determine how likely each stat is to increase when the character levels up.</br>
                    <br>Some characters may excel in physical stats, while others have higher growth in magic or speed.</br>
                </p>

            <button class="accordion">Emblem Rings and Bond Rings</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Emblem Rings</h2>
                <p>
                    Emblem Rings let characters “Engage” with legendary heroes from past Fire Emblem games. 
                    <br>When equipped with an Emblem Ring, a character can merge with the hero’s spirit, gaining access to Engage Skills, special abilities, and stat boosts.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Bonds Levels</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character can build a Bond Level with Emblems by fighting while equipped with their ring. 
                    <br>As Bond Levels increase, the character unlocks additional skills and stat boosts, enhancing their capabilities in combat.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Bonds Rings</h2>
                <p>
                    These are simpler rings that provide minor stat bonuses but don’t allow characters to Engage. 
                    <br>Bond Rings can be created using Bond Fragments and offer collectible, stackable benefits for characters who don’t have an Emblem Ring.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>

            <button class="accordion">Skills and Abilities</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Class Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Each class comes with unique skills that characters automatically gain by being in that class. 
                    <br>These skills provide bonuses or abilities suited to the class role.</br>
                    <br>For example, a healer class might have a skill that boosts healing effectiveness.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Inheritable Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    As characters build Bond Levels with Emblems, they can inherit certain skills permanently. 
                    <br>This allows for further customization, as players can tailor skills to make characters more versatile and better suited to specific combat situations.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Personal Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Each character also has a unique personal skill that reflects their personality or role in the story. 
                    <br>These skills are active regardless of class and provide bonuses or situational advantages.</br>
                    <br>For example, a character might have a personal skill that grants a bonus when near allies or that boosts their damage under certain conditions.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Character customization and Progression</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Leveling Up and Stat Gains</h2>
                <p>
                    Characters gain experience and level up through combat, with random stat gains based on growth rates. 
                    <br>Leveling up is essential for improving a character’s stats and preparing them for class promotion.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Class Change with Seals</h2>
                <p>
                    By using Master Seals (for promotions) and Second Seals (for changing classes), players can explore different character roles, allowing flexibility and experimentation with builds. 
                    <br>This can help optimize a character’s strengths or balance out weaknesses.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Somniel Activities</h2>
                <p>
                    At the Somniel, characters can engage in activities like working out, eating meals, or sparring, which provide temporary buffs and improve Support Levels. 
                    <br>These activities allow players to boost stats or gain minor advantages before entering a battle.</br>
                </p>
                <hr>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Battle Styles</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Styles</h2>
                <p>
                    Battle Styles are a type of attribute assigned to all units. Each grants a unique bonus or ability. In general, the Battle Style a unit has matches up with the type of unit they are, such as:
                    <br>Dragon: Gain additional effects when Engaged with Emblems.</br>
                    <br>Backup: Will engage in Chain Attacks if they are in the range of an enemy being attacked by a player unit.</br>
                    <br>Covert: Receive doubled terrain bonus effects.</br>
                    <br>Mystical: Attack magic ignores enemy terrain bonuses.</br>
                    <br>Qi Adept: Can protect adjacent allies with Chain Guard if their HP is full.</br>
                    <br>Cavalry: Have a higher movement than other units.</br>
                    <br>Armored: Immunity to Break.</br>
                    <br>Flying: Unencumbered by terrain.</br>
                </p>
