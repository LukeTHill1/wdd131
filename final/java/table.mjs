        description: "The Ring of the Hero-King enables to wearer to wield Marth's power in combat. When the twelve Emblem Rings were divided amongst the nations of Elyos, the Ring of the Hero-King was one of the six that was retained by Lythos. While her child slept, Lumera placed the ring on Alears hand, allowing them to bond with the Ring as Marth patiently watched them over the millennium. After a thousand years, Alear suddenly awakens and is brought to Lythos Castle shortly afterwards. To help Alear fully acclimate, Lumera has a sparring session with them and encourages Alear to see if they can awaken the power of the Ring of the Hero-King. Alear suddenly hears an incantation in their mind and recites it, causing the Ring to awaken. Alear would take the Ring of the Hero-King on their journey.",

In the aftermath of the war against the Fell Dragon Sombron, Celica's ring, the Ring of the Caring Princess, was entrusted to the kingdom of Firene. In Chapter 4, Elusia begins its invasion of Firene to steal Firene's Emblem Ring. Queen Ève entrusts the Ring of the Caring Princess to her daughter, Princess Céline, to deliver to the Divine Dragon Alear who had arrived in Firene with Prince Alfred. Céline meets with Alear and Alfred's forces in Florra Mill Town and hands the Ring of the Caring Princess to Alear, allowing them to evoke the ring, restoring Celica's powers. Alear gives the Ring back to Céline to use in the immediate battle against the Elusian forces that were tailing her.",

When the 12 Emblem Rings were distributed to the kingdoms of Elyos, Elusia was given the Ring of the Lady of the Plains to safeguard. Having allied themselves with the Fell Dragon Sombron, King Hyacinth gave the ring to Sombron so the ring could be corrupted. Hyacinth sent a challenge to King Morion of Brodia to face him in combat. Blinded by his sense of honor, Morion accepted his challenge and faced him just outside the Fort on the Border between Brodia and Elusia. The two dueled with Morion quickly gaining the upper hand, forcing Hyacinth to utilize the corrupted Ring of the Lady of the Plains, subduing Morion enough to take him to Elusia so he could use Morion's sovereign blood to revive Sombron. Upon Sombron's revival and the subsequent theft of the Emblem Rings in Alear's possession, Princess Ivy stole the Ring of the Lady of the Plains and delivered it alongside the Ring of the Princess Exalt in the Shadowy Moor as they escaped Elusia into Solm. Alear was able to then purify the Rings and escape successfully.",

When Elusia invades Lythos Castle, the Ring of the Instructor is one of the rings stolen from the Ring Vault. Later, when Alear and their forces invade Elusia to rescue King Morion, King Hyacinth gives Princess Hortensia the Ring of the Instructor to fend off the Divine Dragon's forces, though she is ultimately defeated. After Sombron awakens and Ivy betrays the Fell Dragon, Zephia uses Sombron's corruption of the Ring of the Instructor to control Ivy's sister Hortensia, using her as a pawn to invade the Solm royal palace and acquire the Emblem Ring held by the Solmic royal family. After Alear's forces defeat the controlled Hortensia in grueling battle, the princess is freed of the Fell Dragon's influence, and Alear acquires and purifies the Emblem Ring. The Ring of the Instructor is engraved with a pattern evoking Nabatean design, and features coloration based on Byleth's default clothing colors.",

It was secretly entrusted to Solm with the general public only knowing that they held the Ring of the Radiant Hero. To keep the Ring of the Crux of Fate safe, the Solm royal family hid it in the Northern Fortress where locals urged people to steer clear of due to rumors of haunted spirits infesting it. Using the rumor, very few dared to venture into the ruins. The Ring of the Crux of Fate bears designs similar to Corrin's armor and the inlet gemstone resembles the design of Corrin's Dragonstone.",

They are successful and manage to flee the army in search of Princess Hortensia, eventually reuniting with her at the Azure Coast where she had joined Alear's army. Rosado gives the ring to Alear to awaken Eirika in which Alear gives to Rosado to immediately use in the following battle.
