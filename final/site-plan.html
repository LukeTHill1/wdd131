      <p>
        This home page will explain the story's general plot with minimal spoilers, along with explanations of the new mechanics, the gimmicks added to this game that probably will not make it to others such as Emblem and Bond rings, and the mechanics they are bringing back from past titles such as the build and weight mechanics.

        Plot
          Fire Emblem Engage is a tactical role-playing game set on the continent of Elyos, a land divided into four kingdoms and guarded by divine and demonic forces. The story follows Alear, a Divine Dragon who wakes up after a thousand-year slumber with little memory of their past. Alear learns that the Fell Dragon Sombron, who once plunged the world into chaos, is on the verge of returning. Alear is tasked with gathering Emblem Rings, which summon legendary heroes from other Fire Emblem games, to stop Sombron from unleashing destruction again.
        Throughout the game, Alear and their allies travel across Elyos, forming alliances with the different kingdoms to gather all 12 Emblem Rings and gain the power to oppose Sombron. They face powerful enemies called the Corrupted, creatures raised by Sombron’s dark magic, as well as other followers of the Fell Dragon. Along the way, Alear unlocks fragments of their past and learns about their own connection to Sombron.
        The game combines intense, turn-based battles with social and strategy elements, as players build relationships between characters and use tactical positioning and powerful Emblem skills. With each battle, Alear grows stronger, collecting memories and forging bonds with allies as they march toward the final confrontation with Sombron.

        Mechanics
        Emblem Rings and Engage Mode
        Emblem Rings: Emblem Rings are central to the Engage storyline and gameplay. Each ring contains the spirit of a classic Fire Emblem hero, called an Emblem, who grants the equipped character powerful abilities and stat boosts.
        Engage Mode: By equipping a character with an Emblem Ring, players can "Engage" to merge the character with the Emblem hero for a few turns. In Engage Mode, the character gains enhanced stats and can use powerful Engage Skills and Engage Attacks unique to each Emblem.
        Bond Levels: Characters can build Bond Levels with Emblems, unlocking new skills and additional benefits over time, providing more customization and progression options.
        Breaking
        Weapon Triangle: Fire Emblem Engage revives the weapon triangle, where swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. Mages, archers, and other classes also have their strengths and weaknesses.
        Break Status: When a character wins a weapon triangle matchup, they can “break” the enemy, which prevents the broken enemy from counterattacking for one turn. This mechanic allows for more strategic planning and positioning, as players can use the weapon triangle to temporarily disable dangerous foes.
        The Somniel
        Home Base and Activities: The Somniel is a floating fortress that serves as your base. Similar to Three Houses’ monastery or the Castle in Fates, it allows players to manage their army, engage in side activities, and build relationships with other characters.
        Engage Attacks and Skills
        Engage Attacks: These are powerful, limited-use moves that characters can only access while Engaged with an Emblem. Each Emblem has a unique Engage Attack, often with effects like high-damage multi-hits, crowd control, or healing.
        Engage Skills: Characters also gain access to unique Engage Skills while Engaged. These skills vary based on the Emblem and offer advantages that enhance a character’s role in battle, such as increased evasion, additional weapon proficiency, or healing abilities.
        Revival Stones
        Boss Buff: Revival Stones are a new addition that makes certain boss enemies tougher to defeat. When a boss with a Revival Stone is defeated, they’ll revive with full health for another round.
        Strategic Layer: Players need to carefully plan to take down bosses with Revival Stones, especially on harder difficulties. This adds a layer of challenge, requiring the player to manage resources and time Engage attacks strategically.
        Emblem Bracelets
        DLC Content: Emblem Bracelets were added through downloadable content (DLC), expanding the roster of Emblems with additional heroes from past games, such as the trio from Fire Emblem: Three Houses (Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude) or the dou from Fire Emblem: Awakening (Chrom & Robin).
        Multi-Hero Skills: Certain bracelets allow players to access multiple Emblem heroes at once, offering new skill combinations and Engage Attacks that aren’t available with single Emblem Rings.
        Chain Guards
        Chain Guard: Qi-Adept-type units can protect adjacent allies from damage with Chain Guard, absorbing a hit to shield allies. This action requires full HP, so careful positioning and timing are key to using Chain Guards effectively.
        Returning Mechanics
        Weight
        Weapon Weight: Every weapon in Fire Emblem Engage has a Weight value, which represents how heavy it is for a character to wield. Heavier weapons are generally more powerful but can slow down the character wielding them.
        Impact on Speed: Weapon Weight affects a character's attack speed (AS). If a character's weapon is too heavy, it can reduce their AS, potentially leaving them vulnerable to double attacks from faster opponents or reducing their chances of making follow-up attacks.
        Build
        Characters Build Stat: Each character has a Build (Bld) stat that represents their physical strength and ability to handle heavy weapons. The higher a character's Build, the better they can manage heavier weapons without being penalized in speed.
        Offsetting Weight: The Build stat counteracts a weapon's Weight. If a characters Build is equal to or greater than the Weight of the weapon they’re wielding, there is no penalty to their AS. But if the weapon’s Weight exceeds the character’s Build, they’ll suffer a speed penalty.
        The formula for Attack Speed: The basic formula is: Attack Speed (AS)=Base Speed−(Weapon Weight−Build)
        If Weapon Weight is less than or equal to Build, AS remains unaffected
        If Weapon Weight is greater than Build, AS decreases by the difference between Weight and Build.
        Chain Attacks
        Chain Attacks: Some units, particularly backup units, can perform Chain Attacks when positioned near an ally attacking an enemy. Chain Attacks add additional damage, helping take down tougher enemies more efficiently.

      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be dedicated to the different characters that are given in the mainline and DLC content. This page will start with a few explanations about character skills, classes, their stats, and how they grow. Then there will be a report of each character consisting of a general explanation of how they are, their pros and cons, and how they can be made to stay useful throughout the entire game until the final chapter.
	
          In Fire Emblem Engage, characters are central to both the story and gameplay, each offering unique abilities, personalities, and growth opportunities. Here’s a breakdown of how characters work, including their roles, progression, and roles:
        1. Character Roles and Classes
        Starting Classes: Each character begins in a specific class that determines their initial abilities, stats, weapon proficiencies, and general role on the battlefield. Classes include traditional roles like Sword Fighter, Archer, Mage, Cavalier, and Martial Monk.
        Class Promotions: Characters can upgrade or change classes through a system of promotions. Using Master Seals or Second Seals, players can advance characters to stronger versions of their base class (like Sword Fighter to Swordmaster) or switch them to other classes to fit their playstyle or strategy.
        Advanced Classes: Once promoted, characters can access new abilities, weapons, and improved stats. Some advanced classes have unique skills that enhance a character’s effectiveness and versatility.
        2. Stats and Growth Rates
        Core Stats: Characters have core stats that affect their performance in combat. These include:
        HP (Health Points): Determines how much damage a character can take.
        Strength: Affects physical attack power.
        Magic: Influences the power of magic attacks.
        Dexterity: Affects hit rate and critical hit chance.
        Speed: Determines Attack Speed (AS) and ability to double-attack or avoid being double-attacked.
        Defense: Reduces damage taken from physical attacks.
        Resistance: Reduces damage taken from magical attacks.
        Build: Affects how well a character can wield heavy weapons without a speed penalty.
        Luck: Provides minor boosts to hit rate, dodge rate, and critical avoid rate.
        Growth Rates: Each character has unique growth rates for these stats. These determine how likely each stat is to increase when the character levels up. Some characters may excel in physical stats, while others have higher growth in magic or speed.
        3. Emblem Rings and Bond Rings
        Emblem Rings: Emblem Rings let characters “Engage” with legendary heroes from past Fire Emblem games. When equipped with an Emblem Ring, a character can merge with the hero’s spirit, gaining access to Engage Skills, special abilities, and stat boosts.
        Bond Levels: Each character can build a Bond Level with Emblems by fighting while equipped with their ring. As Bond Levels increase, the character unlocks additional skills and stat boosts, enhancing their capabilities in combat.
        Bond Rings: These are simpler rings that provide minor stat bonuses but don’t allow characters to Engage. Bond Rings can be created using Bond Fragments and offer collectible, stackable benefits for characters who don’t have an Emblem Ring.
        4. Skills and Abilities
        Class Skills: Each class comes with unique skills that characters automatically gain by being in that class. These skills provide bonuses or abilities suited to the class role. For example, a healer class might have a skill that boosts healing effectiveness.
        Inheritable Skills: As characters build Bond Levels with Emblems, they can inherit certain skills permanently. This allows for further customization, as players can tailor skills to make characters more versatile and better suited to specific combat situations.
        Personal Skills: Each character also has a unique personal skill that reflects their personality or role in the story. These skills are active regardless of class and provide bonuses or situational advantages. For example, a character might have a personal skill that grants a bonus when near allies or that boosts their damage under certain conditions.
        5. Character Customization and Progression
        Leveling Up and Stat Gains: Characters gain experience and level up through combat, with random stat gains based on growth rates. Leveling up is essential for improving a character’s stats and preparing them for class promotion.
        Class Change with Seals: By using Master Seals (for promotions) and Second Seals (for changing classes), players can explore different roles for their characters, allowing flexibility and experimentation with builds. This can help optimize a character’s strengths or balance out weaknesses.
        Somniel Activities: At the Somniel, characters can engage in activities like working out, eating meals, or sparring, which provide temporary buffs and improve Support Levels. These activities allow players to boost stats or gain minor advantages before entering a battle.
        6. Battle Styles
        Styles: Battle Styles are a type of attribute assigned to all units. Each grants a unique bonus or ability. In general, the Battle Style a unit has matches up with the type of unit they are, such as:
        Dragon: Gain additional effects when Engaged with Emblems.
        Backup: Will engage in Chain Attacks if they are in the range of an enemy being attacked by a player unit.
        Covert: Receive doubled terrain bonus effects.
        Mystical: Attack magic ignores enemy terrain bonuses.
        Qi Adept: Can protect adjacent allies with Chain Guard if their HP is full.
        Cavalry: Have a higher movement than other units.
        Armored: Immunity to Break.
        Flying: Unencumbered by terrain.

      <h3>Emblems</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be dedicated to the Emblems you can obtain both in the main storyline and the DLC, showing the increases to certain stats that a character can receive just by equipping it, and the different Engage skills and how many skill points (which are received by defeating enemies) each one will cost, along with an explanation of what they do.
        In Fire Emblem Engage, Emblem Rings and Bond Rings are special mechanics that allow players to power up their characters by linking them to the spirits of heroes from past Fire Emblem games. Here’s how both of these mechanics work and what they bring to gameplay:
        1. Emblem Rings
        Emblem Rings are the primary mechanic that allows players to summon the spirits of classic heroes known as Emblems. Each Emblem Ring is linked to a well-known Fire Emblem hero, like Marth or Celica, who grants powerful abilities and special skills. Here’s how they work in detail:
        Summoning Emblems: Characters equipped with Emblem Rings can summon and "Engage" with an Emblem hero. When a character Engages, they merge with the hero's spirit for a few turns, enhancing their stats and unlocking unique abilities.
        Engage Skills: Each Emblem grants character-specific skills and abilities that can turn the tide of battle. For example, Marth’s ring might grant abilities focused on evasion and critical hits, while Celica’s might provide magic-oriented skills.
        Engage Attacks: While Engaged, characters can perform powerful attacks that combine their own abilities with the Emblem’s unique powers. These special moves often have high damage output and added effects depending on the type of battle style the character has.
        Synchronization Bonuses: Characters wearing Emblem Rings gain passive benefits even when they aren’t Engaged. These include stat boosts and minor effects that reflect the Emblem's strengths.
        Bond Levels: Characters can develop bonds with Emblems over time, leveling up these bonds to unlock new skills and stat boosts.
        2. Bond Rings
        Bond Rings are a secondary option for enhancing characters, providing smaller stat boosts and customization options compared to Emblem Rings. Here’s how they function:
        Crafting Bond Rings: Bond Rings are created at the Somniel (your hub area) by spending Bond Fragments. Each Bond Ring corresponds to characters from previous Fire Emblem games, though they’re not as powerful or interactive as Emblem Rings.
        Stat Boosts: Bond Rings provide simple stat bonuses, like +1 to strength, defense, or magic, rather than unique skills or abilities.
        Collectibility and Rarity: Bond Rings come in different rarity levels, from C to S, with higher-ranked rings providing greater stat boosts. Players can collect multiple rings for variety and combine duplicates to increase their rank.
        Supplementary Use: Since you only have a limited number of Emblem Rings, Bond Rings are a helpful way to boost characters who don't have access to an Emblem Ring.
        DLC
        In Fire Emblem Engage, Emblem Bracelets are similar to Emblem Rings, adding another dimension to the gameplay by introducing new Emblems (heroes from past Fire Emblem games) through special bracelets rather than rings. These Emblem Bracelets were added through DLC content and bring unique abilities and tactical possibilities to the game.
        Here’s how Emblem Bracelets work and what they add to the Fire Emblem Engage experience:
        Emblem Bracelets Overview
        New Emblems: Emblem Bracelets introduce additional Emblems that are separate from the main game’s Emblem Rings. For example, characters like Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude from Fire Emblem: Three Houses appear together, or the new guard skills that protect the equipped unit from harm
        Equip and Engage: Just like with Emblem Rings, players can equip characters with Emblem Bracelets, allowing them to “Engage” with these heroes in battle to temporarily gain powerful abilities, stat boosts, and unique skills.
        Emblem Trios: Some Emblem Bracelets, such as the one containing Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude, allow players to Engage with multiple heroes at once. These "Emblem Trios" offer a variety of abilities, sometimes providing access to skills that would otherwise be split across multiple Emblems.
        Unique Skills and Abilities
        Special Skills: Each Emblem Bracelet brings its own set of skills that enhance the character equipped with the bracelet. For instance, the Edelgard/Dimitri/Claude bracelet grants powerful weapon skills and versatility in combat, allowing players to switch between the three heroes’ abilities.
        Engage Attack: Each Emblem Bracelet also provides a unique Engage Attack. The Trio bracelet, for example, has an Engage Attack that deals damage using each hero’s unique weapon type, creating a multi-attack that can break through enemy defenses effectively.
        Bond Level Progression: Like Emblem Rings, Emblem Bracelets have bond levels that increase as you fight with them equipped, unlocking additional skills and stat boosts over time.
